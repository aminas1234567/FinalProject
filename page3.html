<h3>Online Threats and Security Measures </h3>
<p>Phishing is a massive online threat because it tricks people into giving away important information like passwords or bank details. It is effective through through deception and manipulation. It usually happens through emails or messages that look real, mimicking trusted sources like banks, social media platforms, or reputable companies. (Gillis) These messages try to make you click on links or give out personal information. Once a victim falls prey, the consequences can be dire, ranging from identity theft to financial loss. Phishing keeps getting smarter and affects people all over the world. This is why it's crucial to stay alert and protect yourself by being careful about what you share online.</p>

<p>Computer viruses pose a significant online threat, capable of causing widespread damage and disruption. These malicious software programs are designed to infect computers and spread to other devices, often through the internet or infected files. Once inside a system, viruses can corrupt files, steal sensitive information, or even render the entire computer inoperable. (Latto) They often exploit vulnerabilities in software or trick users into downloading them unknowingly. With the ability to replicate and mutate, viruses can quickly escalate. A single virus can escalate into large-scale outbreaks, impacting individuals, businesses, and even critical infrastructure. (Latto) Protecting against these threats is an absolute must.</p>

<p>To protect against phishing and computer virueses, a possible security measure is user education and awareness. By educating users about the risks associated with phishing attacks and how to identify suspicious emails, websites, and links, these attacks can be avoided. Another useful tip is to implement robust email filtering mechanisms, which are able to detect and block phishing emails before they reach users' inboxes. (Gillis) A major security measure is multi-factor authentication. By requiring users to provide multiple forms of verification when accessing sensitive systems or data, such as a password and a temporary code sent to their mobile device, an extra layer of security is added. (Miller) Additionally, secure web browsing is important, which is just referring to using secure connections (HTTPS) for accessing websites and implementing web filtering solutions to block malicious websites. Finally, reputable antivirus and antimalware softwares are crucials, as these are able to detect and remove viruses, malware, and other malicious software. As a sidenote, it's a good idea to keep the antivirus software updated to protect against the latest threats. (Miller)</p>
