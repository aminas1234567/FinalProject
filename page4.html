<p>The evolution of e-commerce has been marked by significant milestones that have reshaped online shopping. Beginning in the early 1970s, where the first online transaction was conducted by a student, e-commerce slowly gained momentum. (Miva) Momentum increased with the emergence of pioneering websites such as Amazon and eBay in the 1990s. These platforms provided consumers with unprecedented access to goods and services, laying the groundwork for the digital marketplace we know today. However, the rapid growth of the dot-com bubble in the late 1990s and its burst in the early 2000s served as a huge moment in e-commerce history. (Miva) This led to the restructuring of online business models. Despite the setbacks, this period of upheaval paved the way for the maturation of e-commerce, fostering innovations in technology and consumer behavior.</p>

<p>As technology continued to advance, the evolution of e-commerce went even further. The addition of mobile commerce (m-commerce) in the mid-2000s was a particular development. (Miva) The growth of smartphones and their use empowered consumers to shop anytime and anywhere. This revolutionized the way businesses interacted with their customers. Furthermore, the integration of social commerce features on platforms like Facebook and Instagram blurred the lines between social networking and online shopping. This created new avenues for product discovery and engagement. With the rise of personalization driven by artificial intelligence (AI) and the seamless blending of online and offline channels, e-commerce has evolved into a dynamic system that continues to shape the future of retail.
